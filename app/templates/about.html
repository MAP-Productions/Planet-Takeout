			<p>In virtually every neighborhood of every city and town in America, there’s a Chinese takeout. Each sits at the intersection where an immigrant worker meets a person who lives down the street, where the needs of the neighborhood are met by the adaptability of takeout owners, where food is exchanged, money, and perhaps words. Places where communication may be difficult but a sense of community can take root.</p>
			<p>There are 10,000 takeouts in the U.S., which prepare more than 2 million meals every day, and who knows how many around the world. Planet Takeout aims to document these takeouts and use them as lenses into our local neighborhoods.</p>
			<p>Enter Planet Takeout, a participatory documentary project about the Chinese takeout as a vital cultural crossroads.</p>
			<p>This is where you come into the picture.</p>
			<p>I bet you’ve gone to one of these takeouts, eaten a few of those meals. Maybe you’re even a regular at one. So much so that the staff knows your order when they hear your voice, perhaps?</p>
			<p>Or maybe you or your family has experience working in or running a takeout. You’ve gotten to know your regular customers’ quirks and adjusted to the life of a small business owner far from home.</p>
			<p>Even if we could clone 10,000 versions of ourselves, you’d still be the one with the story, the one with the relationship across the counter, the one who might know the local characters and the ways the takeout fits into your neighborhood. The one with the memories to share.</p>
			<p>So please help us out!</p>
			<p>We’ve started with four takeouts in Boston. One in Dorchester that created a dollar menu to cater to local teens. Another in Roxbury run by a second-generation takeout owner who coaches a local high school football team on the side. </p>
			<p>But we need your energy and creativity to expand outwards and to paint a portrait of the the city, the country and the planet, takeout by takeout.</p>
			<p><i>Planet Takeout is a collaborative effort by Val Wang, WGBH 89.7, Zeega and the Association of Independents in Radio with funding from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. </i></p>

				<h2>Val Wang, Director</h2>
				<p>Val Wang is a writer and multimedia documentarian who is based in Boston but whose heart is still partly in China. Before Planet Takeout, she produced OpenCourt, WBUR’s cutting-edge project to open the court system through digital technology. She has produced documentaries airing on PBS, National Geographic Channel, and The History Channel and worked for Reuters Television, NBC News, and UNICEF in both New York and Beijing. Her memoir of living in China, Beijing Bastard (working title), is forthcoming from Penguin. She is always thinking about her next meal, and usually the one after that too.</p>
				<h4>First time ate Chinese takeout:</h4>
				<p>While sitting on the floor of boyfriend’s new apartment in Brooklyn, surrounded by moving boxes. Tofu and mixed vegetables from King Kong Chinese Restaurant around the corner. Verdict: Inauthentic but delicious.</p>
				<h4>Most memorable fortune:</h4>
				<p>There is no time like the pleasant.</p>

				<p>Golden Arrows is a graphic design cooperative comprised of Nerissa Cooney and Alexander Hage. After studying design and fine art at Boston University, they formed Golden Arrows in 2009. Working for people who do audacious and inspired work in their communities, they always consider the logic, function and aesthetic of each project, and take a deeply collaborative approach to all their work. They are members of and helped start a creative cooperative workspace that provides a center for people doing social justice and community positive work.
